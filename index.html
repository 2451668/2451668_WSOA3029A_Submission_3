                <h1>Fireballs and bolides</h1>
                <p>This is the revised website about fireballs and bolides as per the data collected from NASA's Fireball Data API, and makes up the final submission for the semester. There are five sections, each of which containing various work done throughout the last few months.</p>
                <p></p>
                <img src = "images/fireball-1.jpeg" alt = "example of a comet">
                <p></p>
                <p>A comet is a celestial object composed primarily of ice, dust, rock, and various organic compounds that orbits the Sun. When comets are far from the Sun, they exist as frozen, dormant objects. However, as they approach the Sun in their elliptical orbits, they begin to heat up, causing the ice within them to vaporize. This process releases gases and dust, forming a glowing coma, or cloud, around the comet's nucleus</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The solar wind and radiation pressure from the Sun push some of this material away from the comet, forming the characteristic tail that points away from the Sun. Comets typically have two types of tails: a dust tail, which is a yellowish or white trail of tiny solid particles, and an ion tail, which appears bluish and is made up of gases that have been ionized by the Sun's ultraviolet radiation.</p>
                <p></p>
                <P>Comets have been observed and studied for centuries, and they are believed to be remnants from the early formation of the solar system, containing important information about its history and composition. As they travel through the inner solar system, they can be visible from Earth and have fascinated people for generations.</P>

                <h1>Fireball plots</h1>
                <p>Overall, a comet's speed is primarily dictated by the balance between the gravitational force from the Sun and the comet's velocity as it traverses its orbit around the Sun. The speed of a comet can change throughout its journey as it gets closer to or moves away from the Sun.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Below is visual for a chart comparing the relationship between energy and velocity of the 20 fastest-ever recorded thus far.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="scatterplot-container"></div>

                 <div class="tooltip" style="opacity: 0;">
                <div><strong>Date:</strong> <span class="date"></span></div>

            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p> Though there is a common trend of stable or uniform comets for most of them, the two outliers are a particularly slow and tired comet near the y axis, and a very energentic one alone at the top. Strangley, whilst being by far the most energentic, it was not the fastest that's been recorded, though is among the top-10 nonetheless. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Below is another graph, this time a line graph, showing some of the norms and extremes of these types of stellar objects.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h3>Factors Influencing Bolide Sightings</h3>
            <p>The chart below is a simple bar chart, showing the frequences at which some sightings have occured at certain places. We can see a few repeat sightings in these places.</p>
            <div class="bar-chart-container"></div>
            <p></p>
            <p>The occurrence or sighting of bolides at certain places can be influenced by several factors:</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>Population Density:</strong> Bolides are more likely to be noticed in areas with higher population density because more people are present to witness and report them.</p>

            <p><strong>Geographic Location:</strong> Certain geographic locations may have a higher likelihood of bolide sightings due to factors like the Earth's orbit intersecting with debris trails, proximity to meteor showers, or other astronomical phenomena.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>Observing Conditions:</strong> Clear and dark skies enhance the visibility of bolides. Regions with less light pollution and favorable weather conditions are more likely to experience frequent bolide sightings.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>Reporting Infrastructure:</strong> The presence of observatories, astronomy clubs, or citizen science initiatives in a region can contribute to more systematic reporting of bolides.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>Media Coverage:</strong> If bolide events receive media coverage, more people may become aware of them and report their sightings. Media attention can create a temporary increase in reporting from specific regions.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>Chance:</strong> Bolides are random events, and their occurrence can be somewhat unpredictable. While certain regions may have a higher statistical likelihood of bolide sightings, chance still plays a significant role.</p>

                <h1>Artistic representation</h1>
                <p></p>
                <p>Below I've created two small pieces of data art based on the data from the charts above. Below is a modified heatmap of the 20 comets, showcasing the differences betwee the "normal" ones and the most energetic</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="heatmap-container"></div>
                <p></p>
                <p>The energy of a bolide, the amount of energy released upon entry into Earth's atmosphere, is determined by factors such as its size, mass, velocity, composition, angle of entry, atmospheric conditions, height of entry, and orbital characteristics.</p>
                <p>Larger and faster bolides generally release more energy, while factors like composition and entry angle also play a role. Predicting exact energy is challenging due to these variables. <p>Observations focus on visible effects like brightness, and bolides often burn up in the atmosphere, converting kinetic energy into heat and light.</p>
                <p></p>
                <div class="radial-chart-container "></div>
                <p>This piece is a modified radial bar chart styled to appear as a black hole, namely the dark centre and infamouse accretion discs, which are the only way people are able to visually characterise them.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Black holes themselves do not directly affect the formation or launching of bolides, and as such their impact on bolides would be negligible unless a black hole were to significantly disturb the trajectory of celestial bodies in its proximity, indirectly affecting potential bolide events. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I've opted to still include this art in relation to the space theme/motif for the site.</p>

                <h1>Blog Section</h1>
                <p>These are the various blog posts done during the semester—tasks focused on information synthesis and content reflection.</p>
                <h2>Overview of Data Visualisation</h2>
                <p>This was the first reflection piece completed, the article, "Overview of Data Visualization" by author Qi Li.</p>
                <p>This is the first blog post for the second semester of interactive media
                    and has us examine and perform a close reading of the chapter,
                    Overview of Data Visualisation, the second in the text, Embodying
                    Data: Chinese Aesthetics, Interactive Visualisation, and Gaming
                    Technologies, by author Qi Li. The following will be a summary of this
                    chapter of the reading as I understood it.</p>
                <p>The text talks about the concept of data visualization, its origins, and
                    where it was and is applied in ancient and modern societies. Going back
                    as far as the 2nd Century, it has roots in the form olds drawings and
                    manual recollections of information, through with the advent of
                    computer processing and graphical software, technology has advanced
                    the field data visualisation, allowing individuals to collect, analyse, and
                    manipulate much larger volumes of information, and with much more
                    accuracy (Li, 2020:16). Li outlines some key advantages of this practice,
                    such as the ability to represent large volumes of date, indeniying
                    emergent properties, understanding both alrge and small scale data,
                    qaulity control, idenitifyign problems, and constructing sound
                    hypothesies. </p>
                <p>This often takes the form of visual, graphical imagery, helping to make
                    sound decisions from the visual representations of which Li says the
                    following in relation to that: “The success of data visualization is due to
                    the soundness of the basic idea behind it: using computer-generated
                    images to gain insight and knowledge from data and its inherent
                    patterns and relationships” (Li, 2020:18).
                    </p>
                <p>Li cites several sources for what data visualization has been defined as 
                    for the time it has been studied, though I have chosen to condense it 
                    into the following: Data visualization is a process that involves 
                    transforming data into a visual or sonic form using computer 
                    technology. It involves the exchange of information between the sender, receiver, and message, utilizing visual perception abilities to 
                    amplify cognition. It is a key element in identifying patterns within a 
                    graphic through exploring and analyzing data. “understanding real 
                    number lines, time, measurement, and estimation, as well as ratio 
                    concepts like fractions, proportions, percentages, and probabilities," Li 
                    writes (Li, 2020:19). She further classes this into two types: information 
                    and scientific visualization, with the former representing abstract dates 
                    and the latter representing physical data. Both are done via an attempt 
                    at conveying graphical data into a visual form. Li goes at length 
                    describing traditional means of data visualization, though I will only 
                    outline them for the purposes of this text, starting with the earliest 
                    mode, trees.</p>
                <p>Tree diagrams hierarchical structure provides a powerful tool for
                    organizing, rationalizing, and illustrating information patterns. The
                    visual metaphor of the tree is used to represent a network of nodes
                    within its branches in data visualization. Some offshoots of this are
                    treemap diagrams, the space-tree, and star-tree diagram, each of course
                    being better suited for representing different data and information (Li,
                    2020:26).
                    </p>
                <p>Following that are simply maps. Maps are graphical depictions that
                    highlight relationships between elements of space, such as objects or
                    regions. The most conventional use is geographic maps, which are used
                    to help people define, explain, and navigate through the world. For
                    instance, road maps, aeronautical and nautical charts, railway or subway
                    network maps, and hiking or bicycling maps Maps were designed and
                    fixed on paper or durable materials. The invention of computer
                    technology has allowed for the development of dynamic and interactive
                    maps. interactive functions, such as zooming in and out (Li, 2020:29).</p>
                <p>Next are the charts. Useful for representing data in line, bar, or slice
                    forms, charts traditionally represent data in the form of a table, graph,
                    or diagram. This form is useful in representing quantitative data that
                    conveys information about sizes or dimensions, and more specifically,
                    in representing correlation and regression in graphic form (Li, 2020:30).</p>
                <p>Tables are another common form of visualization and do so by
                    displaying data within various fields, allowing for efficient comparative data on categorical objects. Featuring rows and columns, they represent
                    data in two dimensions, with quantitative data placed in the squares at
                    the intersection of the row and column. Advantages of this include
                    conveying precise numerical values, aiding viewers in making
                    comparisons, and organizing information where graphing might not be
                    appropriate. An offshoot of that are timetables, a type of table used for
                    referring to and managing tools for scheduled events, tasks, actions, or
                    appointments. They organize data into chronological or alphabetical
                    order, allowing for quicker referencing. Timetables are basic ways to
                    show arrival and departure times for transportation, making them ideal
                    tools for individual time management (Li, 2020:32).
                    </p>
                <p>Next are diagrams, a useful tool for business-related analysis that
                    illustrates information flow through rectangles and lines. Before
                    computer technology, hand-drawn graphs were used, but handling large
                    amounts of data like internet data flow was not so simple. Li, 2020:32).
                    Graphs, similar to diagrams, help perceive and recognize broad features
                    of data or information, providing insight into the data. (Li, 2020:35).
                    Some less intuitive but nonetheless useful forms are waveforms, which
                    represent the shape of time related to various quantities of data;
                    simulations, which enable observers to understand and describe
                    sometimes unique and exotic natural phenomena; and volume
                    visualization, which creates a graphical representation of data sets on
                    3D grids. These are multidimensional arrays of scalar and vector data,
                    typically shown on lattice structures representing values in 3D
                    environments (Li, 2020:40).
                    </p>
                <p>Li concludes by once again reiterating the important practice and role
                    that data visualization has in society and human and technological
                    interaction, with various modes of data visualization aiding in creating
                    readability, recognizability, and meaning for processed information.</p>

                    <h2>Critical Reflection</h2>
                    <p>The following will be a brief analysis and reflection on the
                        proposed UI/UX for our most recent website submission. The
                        subject matter will be integrating NASA’s API in our build, and
                        so the theme by extension will be regarding space and the vast
                        cosmos</p>
                    <p>For the style of the site, I attempted to tie some of the visual elements
                        into the space theme and explore the space motif with the key visuals.
                        The most obvious thematic element is the background of the site. It is
                        an animated background, using a sort of cascading gradient made up of
                        three dark colours along with small white dots in place of stars. The
                        entire element serves as an allusion to the space motive—navigating the
                        site as you would the cosmos. The reference for the background
                        element is the generic scenery of stars when observing the night sky.</p>
                    <p>The rest of the page itself has the contents laid out vertically, similarly
                        to a portrait, as opposed to a more conventional landscape. The two
                        reasons behind this were personal preference and screen space; fitting
                        the background element meant that content and the primary webpage
                        couldn’t occupy the whole screen. Personally, I prefer portraits because hey are easier to read as they are more reminiscent of conventional A4
                        pages and are less visually straining to read and navigate across long
                        texts and elements than short texts and more compact elements. This
                        relates to a practice and idea we learned last semester called "reducing
                        cognitive load," where reducing the amount of visual information the
                        user has to process at a time leads to a less overwhelming experience
                        overall. Having only some text and a primary graphic works better for
                        this (UXpin, 2020). This also keeps the site fairly flexible, as it will be
                        relatively simple to convert to mobile with the use of media queries
                        since the site is already primarily vertically laid out
                        </p>
                    <p>The overall layout and visual structure were centered around a vertical
                        main page where users would scroll down as they engaged with the site
                        and the content, as opposed to clicking away at links and navigation
                        menus (UXpin, 2020).
                        This was reflected in the lead wireframe for the site.
                        </p>
                    <p>In hindsight, I saw the primary drawback to having the page setup this
                        way: that it was difficult to go to and from specific sections of the page
                        without having to do a bit of scrolling. Hiding the scrollbar compounds
                        this problem, even though the site looks cleaner and less cluttered
                        without it. I could remedy this by having the existing navbar be sticky,
                        so that it attaches itself to the top of the screen no matter what section
                        the user has scrolled to. If not a sticky navbar, then a simple “back to
                        top” icon for added functionality This serves to add a “clear next step,"
                        as it were (UXpin, 2020). One other thing I may consider is creating a
                        custom scrollbar with CSS as well as a custom cursor to better match
                        the space motif.
                        The only font present is Poppins sans-serif, a typeface by Jonny
                        Pinhorn and a favorite of mine. Doing well in terms of readability and
                        legibility, I went with a bolder or more weighted look for much of the
                        text on the site for more clarity and visual appeal. Having generic black
                        text on a black background is quite underwhelming, even with good
                        fonts, so an alternative I would try is inverting that by having the text
                        light and the page dark, though I would need to play around with that
                        because the rest of the page and backgrounds are also dark, so having
                        only the text be light may be jarring to look at. What having a white
                        backdrop does help with is creating visual interest since the content of
                        the large would not be as blank and sandwiched between it and the
                        starry background. This would also not impact how the user would
                        consume information.</p>
                    <p>Having all the content aligned vertically and symmetrically goes back to
                        the theory of Victor Papanek, the late designer and educator, in his
                        reading, Design for the Real World, and his insights about symmetry:
                        “. . .we impose our intent and may produce some sort of symmetrical
                        alignment. A symmetrical-order system is a favourite of small children,
                        unusually primitive peoples, and some of the insane, because it is so
                        easy to understand. Further shifting will produce an infinite number of
                        asymmetrical arrangements that require a higher level of sophistication
                        and greater participation on the part of the viewer to be understood and
                        appreciated.” (Papanek, 2006)
                        </p>
                    <p>It’s somewhat longwinded, but what I took from it is that visual
                        hierarchy is important in design and when presenting information. As
                        such, I aimed to reflect that in what information to have in any section
                        at any given moment, and I will improve on that in the next iteration of
                        the site in a week’s time.

                    <h2>Interaction for Data Visualisation</h2>
                    <p>The reading for this task was the article, What is Interaction for Data Visualization?, by
                        assistant professors Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin, which talks about some of the
                        ambiguity and confusion around the idea of interaction in data visualisation, and
                        attempts to define the term to better serve users and practitioners of design and aid
                        visualisation systems.
                        I figured that before doing the reading, I would first consolidate the web to get some
                        general ideas for a definition. While typically nonspecific, I have found that dictionary
                        definitions give a more general and intuitive understanding of terminology than jumping
                        straight into text on a blank slate.
                        “An interaction technique, user interface technique or input technique is a combination
                        of hardware and software elements that provides a way for computer users to
                        accomplish a single task.” (Wikipedia, 2022)</p>
                    <p>“Data and information visualization presumes that "visual representations and
                        interaction techniques take advantage of the human eye's broad bandwidth pathway into
                        the mind to allow users to see, explore, and understand large amounts of information at
                        once. Information visualization focused on the creation of approaches for conveying
                        abstract information in intuitive ways.” (Wikipedia, 2023)
                        “mutual or reciprocal action or influence” (Merriam-Webster, 2023)
                        Most of these did not necessarily have to do with “interaction” as a topic in and of itself,
                        but some of the components and mechanisms around it. This was actually mentioned in
                        the text as I got to read it, where the authors made it a point to differentiate interaction
                        through interactive techniques.
                        Three instances of this are discussed here, including interaction, interaction technique,
                        and interactivity (Dimara & Perin, 2020; 5). The first and most relevant has to do with
                        the dialogue between users and the visualisation system—the user actions and system
                        responses, so to speak. The techniques are the means (hardware and software) through
                        which interaction can take place. What we are more broadly familiar with as students, many of which we covered in the previous blog post about data vis (Li, 2020), Lastly,
                        there was interactivity more generally, encompassing the overall feel, properties, and
                        quality of interactions, with an emphasis on the user's experience. Another aspect
                        mentioned was the science or study of interactivity, which is still broader but beyond the
                        scope of the article (Dimara & Perin, 2020; 5). Even still, it was good to see and learn
                        about the different facets of interaction, and the authors attempted to make sense of
                        them.
                        Within this context however, it is interaction within the realm of data vis, and so this was
                        the definition put forth by the authors:
                        </p>
                        <p>“Interaction for visualization is the interplay between a person and a data interface involving a
                            data-related intent, at least one action from the person and an interface reaction that is perceived as
                            such.” (Dimara & Perin, 2020; 8)
                            In their own words, this definition is “compact” (Dimara & Perin, 2020; 8), but is quite
                            loaded in terms of content to unpack and is a pretty robust framework. The main points
                            as I understood them were: interplay (which describes the interaction or exchange; may
                            not always be linear or sequential), person (simply the agent; not necessarily always
                            human), data interface (entity that the agent interacts with, forming the other half of the
                            interaction), action (the physical or mental input by the agent), reaction (the interface’s
                            response to said action), and lastly reaction perception (the tangible response ought to be
                            perceived by the agent) (Dimara & Perin, 2020; 8–9).
                            This causality or cause-and-effect relationship is what governs, and is the foundation for
                            the whole interaction model.
                            For some context on some of the terms in the definition, in particular the ideas of
                            actions and entities, this is what I took from the beginning portion of the article. In the
                            context of interaction through data visualisation, there are internal and external factors
                            for both actions and entities.
                            External entities are the user or agent and their motivations for initiating the interaction.
                            Data is another, and of course, the agent’s main point of interest. The mediating entity is
                            responsible for providing controls to access data. Time is another and has to do with
                            temporal functions of cause-and-effect, as I mentioned above (Dimara & Perin, 2020; 3–
                            4). Internally, there is the goal-oriented aspect of the interaction, which has to do with user intent, which the authors note exists at both low and high levels of operation.
                            (Dimara & Perin, 2020; 4).
                            For actions, there is the dialogue or interplay between the user and the system; actions
                            and inputs; reactions and outputs. Internally, these do not only include physical actions
                            but also cognitive activities of the user, such as reasoning, analysing, and other cognitive
                            acts related to the data (Dimara & Perin, 2020; 4).
                            The authors laid out a concrete definition for interaction for data visualization, which has
                            a lot to do with human intent, means of actions and interactions, and the resulting
                            causality that I took a lot from as I worked through understanding it. Dimara & Perin,
                            2020, 10). They stated that it was their intent with the piece to propose a definition that
                            unifies the visualisation community and aids in improving the quality of visual systems
                            within their field. As an undergraduate student, I don’t personally relate too much to
                            anything that ambitious, as my only goal is to learn, understand, and think about new
                            ways of thinking. In the context of interaction and data visualisation, this article has
                            helped a lot.

                <h1>Design</h1>
                <p>This will cover some of the design thoughts and decisions for this boiler site and planning for the finished build.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Above are simple wireframes for the overall look and functionality of the site. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>It features ample padding and wide margins for clarity, as well as room to showcase the panning background elements. This was styled this way to give the impression of the viewer zooming through space as they navigate the site.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>This is to lend into the space motif a bit, as the user feels like they are exploring the deep expanse while scrolling the site and having the background visuals as accents. This is also the reason I have decided to forgo separate pages and rather have them as sections the user scrolls to. The navbar provides sticky functionality so as not to burden the user by having to manually scroll up in order to change sections. They were also made a dark colour; dark enough to still be legible, but glow when hovering over them, as if to liken them to stars in the night sky. This was also the reason I chose a dark grey for the whole site, and light colours for the content. The navbar is costant, and for legibility is darker than the main body of the page.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The global font for the site is Poppins sans-serif. It has some good readability and legibility, and because of the uniformity in the characters, it should not develop any strange or overlapping artefacts when italicised or bolded.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The data vis and art feature some unique choices as well, as the various points on the graphs animate on hover like with the navbar elements. The scatterplot in particular does a rising and glowing animation, much like meteors pacing in the night. This doubles as a representation of the energy levels the graph is meant to convey.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The two data art pieces feature animations as well, which in addition to being pretty to look at, server the space metaphore/narrative with the heatmap being a literal representation of the heat and energy of various comets, still highlighting outliers in the sample. The second represents a black hole, which is dark in the centre and features glowing bar charts as placeholders for a black hole's accretion disc which is glowing hot plasma. A glow effect was achieved with some bluring effects in the script file.</p>
                <p>I will disclose that the data had being slightly constrained to values that better translate to an artistic and aesthetic expression, but still represent the original sources values in terms of range and magnitude, even if the degrees were modified.</p>
                <p>I had aimed for the overall site to be simple and minimal, and I had decided to do away with complex graphics and animations so as not to overwhelm the user or lead to something jarring and instead have subtle background effects and allow the content to generate visual interest once it has been implemented. All the decisions made in the site served to propose and enhance a space related theme, in accordance to the NASA API which was the primary subject matter for this project, and to that end, while hardly perfect, was a strong attempt on my part.
